### Describe how leadership styles influence a corporate culture

**Leading** is the process of guiding and motivating others toward achieving organizational goals.

**Sources of Power:**

- _Legitimate &mdash;_ derived from an individual's position within the org. Being high ranked automatically gives a person presence
- _Reward &mdash;_ person's control over rewards. Seems like any type of reward will do, like making a company is a "reward" that gives him power, coz you want to respect someone that will make your workplace successful.
- _Referent &mdash;_ Power of appearance. At a hospital, you'd ask the person wearing a stethoscope for help with your sick child, instead of the guy with a mop wouldn't you? Not just appearance, but just charisma and admiration from others.
- _Expert &mdash;_ Can override the legitimate power because of their knowledge and expertise.
- _Coercive &mdash;_ Someone who will force the issue to get things done, because of negative outcomes that may occur.

#### Leadership styles of management

##### Autocratic
- Manager makes most decisions and acts in authoritative manner
- Manager is usually unconcerned about subordinate's attitude toward decisions.
- Emphasis on getting task accomplished.

_Approach is used mostly by military officers and some production line supervisors._

##### Participative Style


##### Free-Rein (Laissez-Faire)


#### Empowerment
Process of giving employees increased autonomy and discretion to make decisions and control over the resources needed to implement those decisions.

_Example:_ At a hotel, if customer not satisfied with meal, server can redo the meal, if still not satisfied, manager can offer wine or free desert, if still not satisfied, can comp the entire meal, if that customer was an absolute bitch, hotel manager can comp guest into a higher suite.

#### Corporate Culture
Set of attitudes, values, and standards of behaviour that distinguishes one organization from another
