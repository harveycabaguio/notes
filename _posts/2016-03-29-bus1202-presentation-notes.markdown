### Early entry into youth market

We want to support the next generation of bikers as early as possible, so our first key decision was to enter the youth market as  soon as we can. Because we entered the market first, we were able to gain a larger mind share, and sell **34%** more bikes than our only competitor in this market, the **6th Element Group**. We are also still growing in this market, with a potential **10,000** more buyers of our bikes in the upcoming year.

### Diversified offerings

Of course, we want _everyone_ to ride a bike. That's why we are offering bikes for all types of people. After introducing a youth bike, we introduced a second mountain bike, where we had sold more  mountain bikes than the other companies on the year 2022. We also introduced a road bike the following year, allowing us to cannibalize the sales of **MBI** and **6th Element Group**, the latter who we directly competed in price in this market, sold a 1000 less bikes compared to the previous year.

### Supporting distribution channels

In order to sell as many bikes as possible to customers, we had to support our distribution channels. Our strategy here was to provide as much monetary support to stores as we can while keeping the margins low, so that we can maximize profits while giving stores incentive to carry our product. This worked very well with discount stores, where **80%** of 1000 discount stores carried our products.
