### Early entry into youth market

We want to support the next generation of bikers as early as possible, so our first key decision was to enter the youth market as early as possible. Because we entered the market first, we were able to gain a larger mind share, and sell **34%** more bikes than our only competitor in this market, **6th Element Group**. We are also still growing in this market, with a potential **10,000** more buyers of our bikes in the upcoming year.

### Diversified offerings

Of course, its not just children who we want to ride a bike. We want _everyone_ to ride one. That's why we are offering bikes for all types of people. After introducing a youth bike, we introduced a second mountain bike, causing us to sell more mountain bikes than our competitors in the 2022 year. We also introduced a road bike the following year, allowing us to cannibalize the sales of **MBI** and **6th Element Group**, the latter who was also our direct competitor in price, sold a 1000 less bikes compared to the previous year.

### Supporting distribution channels

In order to sell as many bikes as possible to customers, we had to support our distributing channels. Our strategy was here was to provide as much monetary support to stores as we can while keeping the margins low, so that we can maximize profits while giving stores incentive to carry our product. This worked very well with discount stores, where **80%** of 1000 discount stores carried our products.
